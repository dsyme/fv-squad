# Formal Verification Research

> 🔬 *Lean Squad — automated formal verification for this repository.*

## Repository Overview

This repository is a Rust implementation of the [Raft distributed consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/), derived from the TiKV `raft-rs` crate. The codebase implements the core Consensus Module (not Log, State Machine, or Transport layers).

**Primary language**: Rust (52 `.rs` files)  
**FV tool chosen**: Lean 4 + Mathlib  
**Aeneas feature**: The codebase has an `aeneas` Cargo feature that replaces unsafe stack-array optimisations with safe `Vec` equivalents in `quorum/majority.rs`, making automatic Lean extraction via the Charon+Aeneas toolchain viable for that module.

## Why Lean 4?

- Lean 4 + Mathlib provides rich automation (`omega`, `simp`, `decide`) well-suited to the arithmetic and list-manipulation properties in Raft.
- The `aeneas` Cargo feature in this repo explicitly signals maintainer interest in Lean-based FV.
- Charon+Aeneas can mechanically extract Lean from the safe-Rust variants.

## FV Target Survey

### Target 1: `util::limit_size` ⭐⭐⭐ (Top Priority)

**File**: `src/util.rs`  
**Function**: `pub fn limit_size<T: PbMessage + Clone>(entries: &mut Vec<T>, max: Option<u64>)`

**What it does**: Truncates a vector of protobuf entries so that the total serialised byte size stays within `max`. Always preserves at least one entry.

**Why FV-amenable**:
- Pure functional effect (truncation of a list)
- Clear, textbook postconditions: prefix property, non-empty guarantee, size bound
- Existing doctests provide concrete specification hints
- No I/O, no unsafe code, minimal dependencies

**Key properties to verify**:
1. **Non-empty**: `limit_size(entries, max)` always leaves `|entries| ≥ 1` when input was non-empty
2. **Prefix**: the result is a prefix of the original list
3. **Size bound**: the total serialised size of the result respects `max` (unless capped at 1)
4. **Idempotence**: applying `limit_size` twice with the same `max` is a no-op
5. **No-op cases**: `limit_size` with `max = None` or `max = NO_LIMIT` is a no-op

**Proof tractability**: Very high — equational reasoning + `omega` + `simp`. Modelled as a pure list function abstracting away protobuf serialisation.

**Approximations needed**: The Lean model must abstract `compute_size()` as a function `size : α → ℕ`. Overflow of `u64` during size accumulation is not modelled (treated as non-overflowing in the spec).

---

### Target 2: `config::Config::validate` ⭐⭐⭐ (Top Priority)

**File**: `src/config.rs`  
**Function**: `pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<()>`

**What it does**: Validates a `Config` struct, returning `Ok(())` iff a conjunction of arithmetic constraints holds:
- `id ≠ 0`
- `heartbeat_tick > 0`
- `election_tick > heartbeat_tick`
- `min_election_tick ≥ election_tick`
- `min_election_tick < max_election_tick`
- `max_inflight_msgs > 0`
- `read_only_option == LeaseBased → check_quorum`
- `max_uncommitted_size ≥ max_size_per_msg`

**Why FV-amenable**:
- Fully decidable conjunction of arithmetic predicates
- No side effects
- The spec is literally the conjunction of the error conditions (inverted)

**Key properties to verify**:
1. **Soundness**: `validate(c) = Ok(())` iff all constraints hold
2. **Completeness**: the code checks every required constraint (no gaps)
3. **Redundancy check**: are any constraints implied by others? (interesting finding potential)

**Proof tractability**: Very high — `decide` closes decidable arithmetic propositions. Can be modelled as a pure predicate.

**Approximations needed**: `ReadOnlyOption` enum modelled as a two-element Lean inductive type.

---

### Target 3: `quorum::majority::Configuration::vote_result` ⭐⭐

**File**: `src/quorum/majority.rs`  
**Function**: `pub fn vote_result(&self, check: impl Fn(u64) -> Option<bool>) -> VoteResult`

**What it does**: Given a set of voter IDs and a function mapping voter → Some(yes)/Some(no)/None(missing), returns `Won`, `Pending`, or `Lost` based on whether a majority of yes/no has been reached.

**Why FV-amenable**:
- Pure function over a finite set
- Clear majority-quorum specification
- `aeneas`-safe variant available

**Key properties to verify**:
1. `vote_result(∅, _) = Won` (empty config wins by convention)
2. If `yes ≥ ⌈n/2⌉ + 1` then `Won`
3. If `yes + missing < ⌈n/2⌉ + 1` then `Lost`
4. Monotonicity: replacing `None` with `Some(true)` cannot change `Won → Pending/Lost`

**Proof tractability**: High — `omega` + `simp`.

---

### Target 4: `quorum::majority::Configuration::committed_index` ⭐⭐

**File**: `src/quorum/majority.rs`  
**Function**: `committed_index(use_group_commit, l)`

**What it does**: Computes the highest log index that has been acknowledged by a quorum (the `(n/2+1)`-th largest acked index). The `aeneas` feature provides a safe-Rust equivalent for automatic extraction.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. The result is ≤ every element in the top-quorum of acked indices
2. The result is ≥ the minimum acked index in the voters set (lower bound)
3. Empty config returns `u64::MAX`

**Proof tractability**: Medium — requires lemmas about sorted lists and indexing.

---

### Target 5: `raft_log::RaftLog::find_conflict` ⭐⭐

**File**: `src/raft_log.rs`  
**Function**: `pub fn find_conflict(&self, ents: &[Entry]) -> u64`

**What it does**: Scans a slice of entries and returns the index of the first entry whose term does not match the stored log, or 0 if all entries match.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. Return value is the index of the first conflicting entry, or 0
2. All entries before the returned index match the log
3. Monotone scan (no backtracking)

**Proof tractability**: High once `match_term` is abstracted as a predicate.

---

### Target 6: `raft_log::RaftLog::maybe_append` ⭐

**File**: `src/raft_log.rs` — Depends on `find_conflict`. Medium tractability.

---

### Target 7–8: `quorum::joint` ⭐

**File**: `src/quorum/joint.rs` — Joint quorum operations, depend on Targets 3 and 4.

---

### Target 9: `tracker::inflights` ⭐

**File**: `src/tracker/inflights.rs`  
**Struct**: `pub struct Inflights` — FIFO ring buffer for tracking in-flight Raft messages

**What it does**: Tracks log indices of sent-but-unacknowledged AppendEntries RPCs.
The leader uses this to bound the pipeline window (up to `cap` messages in flight).

**Data structure**:
- `buffer : Vec<u64>` — ring buffer of capacity `cap`
- `start : usize` — index of the oldest (first valid) entry in the ring
- `count : usize` — number of valid entries currently stored (`0 ≤ count ≤ cap`)
- `cap : usize` — maximum capacity
- `incoming_cap : Option<usize>` — pending capacity resize (applied when buffer drains)

**Key operations**:
| Method | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| `new(cap)` | Creates empty buffer with capacity `cap` |
| `add(v)` | Appends `v` to the ring (panics if `full()`) |
| `free_to(k)` | Removes all entries ≤ `k` from the front |
| `free_first_one()` | Removes the single oldest entry |
| `reset()` | Clears all entries; applies any pending cap resize |
| `full()` | True iff `count = cap` (or pending cap already reached) |
| `set_cap(n)` | Schedules a capacity resize to `n` |

**Why FV-amenable**:
- The *logical content* is simply an ordered sequence of `u64` values — the ring
  buffer is a performance detail orthogonal to the correctness properties.
- Clear pre/postconditions for each operation.
- The `free_to` correctness criterion ("all entries ≤ k are removed, others remain")
  is a textbook invariant, provable by induction on the sequence.
- Well-covered by existing unit tests that serve as specification hints.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. **Capacity invariant** (`INF-1`): `count ≤ cap` is maintained by all operations.
2. **`add` content** (`INF-2`): After `add(v)`, `v` is the last element of the logical sequence.
3. **`free_to` correctness** (`INF-3`): After `free_to(k)`, no remaining entry satisfies `≤ k`.
4. **`free_to` preservation** (`INF-4`): After `free_to(k)`, all entries that were `> k` are still present.
5. **`reset` clears** (`INF-5`): After `reset()`, `count = 0`.
6. **`full` spec** (`INF-6`): `full() = true ↔ count = cap` (ignoring `incoming_cap` case).

**Lean model**:
- Abstract the ring buffer as `List Nat` (the ordered sequence of inflights).
- `add` ≡ `l ++ [v]`
- `free_to k` ≡ `l.dropWhile (· ≤ k)`
- `full` ≡ `l.length = cap`
- No need to model the ring layout — that is an implementation detail.
- `set_cap` and `incoming_cap` can be modelled separately or omitted in a first pass.

**Proof tractability**: High for INF-1, INF-2, INF-5, INF-6 (direct from definitions).
Medium for INF-3, INF-4 (require `dropWhile` induction). No difficult arithmetic.

**Approximations**:
- Ring layout (`start`, `buffer` vec) abstracted away — Lean model is a pure `List Nat`.
- `incoming_cap` resize logic omitted in the first pass (it is a secondary concern).
- `u64` → `Nat` (no overflow concern; inflights are log indices, bounded in practice).
- `add` panic on full buffer not modelled (assumed pre: `¬full()`).

**Recommended next step**: Task 2 — write `formal-verification/specs/inflights_informal.md`.

---

### Target 10: `tracker::progress` state machine ⭐

**File**: `src/tracker/progress.rs` — Progress state machine transitions. Medium tractability.

---

## Approach Summary

| Phase | Tool | Strategy |
|-------|------|----------|
| Spec | Lean 4 + Mathlib | Hand-written types + propositions |
| Impl | Lean 4 | Pure functional model (`partial def` where needed) |
| Proofs | Lean 4 tactics | `omega`, `simp`, `decide`, `induction` |
| Extraction (optional) | Charon + Aeneas | Auto-extract from `--features aeneas` variants |

We prioritise Targets 1 and 2 first (highest tractability, standalone specs). Targets 3–4 next (Aeneas-compatible). Targets 5–6 after.

## Current Project State (Run 47)

- **32 Lean files**, **505 proved theorems**, **0 sorry**, **Lean 4.28.0**
- Top-level safety theorem `raftReachable_safe` (RT2) proved.
- `ConcreteProtocolStep.lean` (CPS1–CPS13) bridges concrete AppendEntries to RT2.
- `ElectionReachability.lean` (ER1–ER12) reduces `CandidateLogCovers` to the shared-source condition.
- `ElectionConcreteModel.lean` (ECM1–ECM7) closes `hqc_preserved` from the `hae` hypothesis.
- **Key insight**: ECM6 (`hqc_preserved_of_validAEStep`) proves that `hqc_preserved` holds
  given (a) the leader won the election, (b) voters' logs agree with the leader up to their
  last index (`hae`), and (c) a valid AE step fires. The remaining gap is now:

  > **Derive `hae` inductively** from the concrete AE broadcast history.
  > ECM5 gives `hae` for a single AE step (indices > prevLogIndex). The inductive case
  > needs to show that this agreement is maintained across all AE steps from one leader.

### Priority for future runs:
1. **Task 5 (Proofs)**: `hae` inductive invariant — new file `AEBroadcastInvariant.lean`:
   - Define `HAEInvariant cs lead` := `∀ w k, k ≤ (voterLog w).index → cs.logs w k = cs.logs lead k`
   - Prove it is preserved by `ValidAEStep` from lead to any voter v
   - Compose with ECM6 to get `hqc_preserved` without `hae` as explicit hypothesis
   - ~10–20 theorems
2. **Task 5 (Proofs)**: Complete RaftLogAppend Phase 5:
   - P6: batch suffix matches (result log has the new entries starting at their indices)
   - P7: entries beyond the batch are discarded (truncation correctness)
3. **Task 7 (Critique)**: Update CRITIQUE.md with Runs 43–46 findings:
   - ElectionConcreteModel.lean (ECM1–ECM7) section
   - Updated theorem counts (483→505)
   - Paper review update for new sections
4. **Task 11 (Paper)**: Update paper.tex with theorem counts 505/32, new sections on:
   - ElectionReachability.lean (ER1–ER12)
   - ElectionConcreteModel.lean (ECM1–ECM7)
   - RaftLogAppend.lean (RA1–RA9+3, P4/P5)
5. **Target 11** (`progress_set`) — still lower priority than closing the inductive gap
6. **Aeneas extraction** — still blocked on container privileges

## Mathlib Modules Expected to Be Useful

- `Mathlib.Data.List.Basic` — list prefix, length, `take`
- `Mathlib.Data.List.Sort` — sorted list properties
- `Mathlib.Algebra.Order.Ring.Lemmas` — arithmetic inequalities
- `Mathlib.Data.Finset.Basic` — finite set majority reasoning
- `Std.Data.List.Lemmas` — list operations

## Aeneas Applicability

The codebase explicitly supports Aeneas via the `aeneas` Cargo feature. The `committed_index` and `vote_result` functions have safe-Rust variants ready for Charon extraction. Task 8 (Aeneas Extraction) should be attempted once the Charon+Aeneas toolchain is available in the CI environment.

## Run 67 Update (2026-04-21) — FindConflictByTerm + Next Targets

**Current state**: 552 theorems, 47 Lean files, 0 sorry.

### Completed This Run
`find_conflict_by_term` (Task 3/5): `RaftLog::find_conflict_by_term` formalised in
`FVSquad/FindConflictByTerm.lean` (10 theorems, 0 sorry). Key properties proved:
- **FCB1**: Result index ≤ input index (scan is bounded)
- **FCB2**: Returned term ≤ query term (correctness of scan exit)
- **FCB3**: Maximality — every index above result has term > query term
- **FCB4**: Identity — immediate return when first entry matches
- **FCB5/FCB7**: Out-of-range guard correctness
- **FCB6**: The model always returns `Some` (no storage-error path)
- **FCB8**: Base-case characterisation (dummy entry at index 0)
- **FCB9**: Monotone log implies maximality (delegates to FCB3)

### Research Directions for Future Runs

1. **Connect to fast-reject path** (`handle_append_response`, `src/raft.rs ~L1657`):
   prove that `find_conflict_by_term` output is a valid probe point for the leader.

2. **`progress_set`** (`src/tracker/progress_set.rs`): `ProgressSet::quorum_active` —
   informal spec + Lean spec. Would bridge per-peer `Progress` model to full-cluster
   quorum tracking.

3. **Connect AEBroadcastInvariant to election lifecycle**:
   after an election, the leader broadcasts AE; ABI8 should apply. Requires composing
   `RaftElection.lean` → `ElectionConcreteModel.lean` → `AEBroadcastInvariant.lean`.

4. **Update conference paper** (`formal-verification/paper/paper.tex`):
   Runs 60–67 add ReadOnly (15T), FindConflictByTerm (10T), 0-sorry milestone.
   Section on correspondence tests (12 targets, 160+ #guard cases) needs expansion.

## Run 82 Update (2026-04-22) — RaftLogAppend Correspondence + Research Refresh

**Current state**: 522 theorems, 52 Lean files (53 with new RaftLogAppendCorrespondence.lean), 0 sorry.

### Task 8: RaftLogAppendCorrespondence

`RaftLog::append` (from `src/raft_log.rs:382`) now has a correspondence test in
`FVSquad/RaftLogAppendCorrespondence.lean` (21 `#guard` assertions, 0 sorry) and a
matching Rust test `test_raft_log_append_correspondence` (11 assertion cases, all pass).

This completes the correspondence test coverage for all major Lean proof targets:
**17 correspondence-test files** covering **17 Rust functions** with **342+ `#guard` tests**.

The three structural branches of `truncate_and_append` are all exercised:
1. **Append** (`after = offset + len`): new entries attached at the end
2. **Replace** (`after ≤ offset`): new batch replaces all unstable entries
3. **Truncate + append** (`offset < after < offset + len`): partial overwrite

Invariants RA4 (`committed` unchanged) and RA5 (`stableLastIdx` unchanged) are
cross-checked at the Rust level, closing the model-to-implementation gap.

### Critique-Driven Research Adjustments

Based on `CRITIQUE.md` Run 76 recommendations:

1. **firstUpdateIndex modelling** (MaybePersist gap): The `maybe_persist` model treats
   `firstUpdateIndex` as an opaque `Nat`. In the Rust implementation this is derived from
   `unstable.snapshot?.index + 1` or `unstable.offset`. Formalising this derivation would
   promote MP6 from "parameter correct" to "derivation correct". Target: add a
   `MaybePersistFUI.lean` formalising the FUI derivation from `LogUnstable`.

2. **Progress ↔ ProgressTracker integration**: `Progress.lean` (31T, 0 sorry) and
   `ProgressCorrespondence.lean` (55 `#guard`) cover the per-peer invariants. The
   multi-peer `ProgressTracker::update_committed` and `ProgressTracker::quorum_active`
   are not yet formalised. Target: `ProgressSet.lean` lifting invariants to multi-peer.

3. **AEBroadcastInvariant ↔ election lifecycle**: `AEBroadcastInvariant.lean` (ABI1–ABI10)
   proves that after a broadcast AE round, `hqc_preserved` holds. The remaining gap is
   connecting this to the full Raft election protocol — showing that a post-election
   leader actually performs such a broadcast. Target: compose `RaftElection.lean` →
   `ElectionConcreteModel.lean` → `AEBroadcastInvariant.lean` into a single chain.

4. **Conference paper recompilation**: `formal-verification/paper/paper.tex` was last
   updated in Run 81 with Run-81 numbers. LaTeX compilation requires `latexmk` (not
   currently available in the sandbox). Paper needs updating for Runs 78–82 changes
   (MaybePersistCorrespondence, MaybeCommitCorrespondence, RaftLogAppendCorrespondence).

### Next High-Priority Research Targets (Run 85 Update)

> **Run 84 completed**: B1 (`firstUpdateIndex` / `MaybePersistFUI.lean`) is **done** — 8
> theorems (FU1–FU8, 0 sorry) formalise the FUI derivation from `Unstable` fields (snap case
> and no-snap case), plus 20 `#guard` correspondence tests in `MaybePersistFUICorrespondence.lean`
> and a Rust test with 18 cases. FU7 (`maybePersistFui_snap_blocks_advance_at`) is the key
> safety property.

The current state (Run 84/85): **55 Lean files, ~530 theorems, 0 sorry, 18 correspondence
test targets with 362+ `#guard` tests**.

| Priority | Target | Goal | Difficulty | Files | Status |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| ~~**B1**~~ | ~~`firstUpdateIndex`~~ | ~~Formalise FUI derivation~~ | ~~Low~~ | `MaybePersistFUI.lean` | ✅ **Done (Run 84)** |
| **B2** | `progress_set` | `ProgressSet::quorum_active` informal + Lean spec | Medium | `ProgressSet.lean` | ⬜ Not started |
| **B3** | Election-broadcast chain | Compose election → broadcast → ABI8 | High | `ElectionBroadcastChain.lean` | ⬜ Not started |
| **B4** | REPORT.md + paper.tex | Update for Runs 78–84 (18 corr files, 362+ #guard) | Low | `REPORT.md`, `paper.tex` | ⬜ Needs update |

### B2 Detail: `ProgressSet::quorum_active`

**File**: `src/tracker/progress_set.rs`  
**Function**: `ProgressSet::quorum_active(&self) -> bool`

**What it does**: Returns `true` if a majority of voters in the configuration have been
"recently active" (their `Progress.recent_active` flag is set). Used to detect whether the
cluster is still live enough to respond without confirming quorum each time (avoid lease
transfers on short partitions).

**Key properties to verify**:
1. If `|voters| = 0`, result is vacuously true
2. Monotone: adding a `recent_active=true` voter cannot flip `false → true` in reverse
3. Consistency with `HasQuorum`: `quorum_active ↔ hasQuorum(voters, fn(v) => progress(v).recent_active)`
4. Lifting: per-peer `Progress` invariants (PR1–PR35) apply to each tracked peer

**Proof tractability**: Medium — builds directly on `HasQuorum.lean` and `Progress.lean`.
The key insight is that `quorum_active` is syntactic sugar for `has_quorum` applied to
the `recent_active` boolean field.

**Approximations**: `ProgressSet` has a `group_commit_mode: bool` flag and joint
configuration support. The initial spec can focus on the simple (non-joint) case.

### B3 Detail: Election-Broadcast Chain

**Goal**: Close the final gap in the Raft safety proof by showing that after a legitimate
election, the new leader performs the initial AE broadcast described in
`ElectionConcreteModel.lean`, and therefore `hqc_preserved` holds inductively.

**Proof path**:
1. `RaftElection.lean` (RE1–RE15): election safety (one leader per term)
2. `ElectionConcreteModel.lean` (ECM1–ECM7): after broadcast, `hqc_preserved` holds
3. `AEBroadcastInvariant.lean` (ABI1–ABI10): inductive invariant for broadcast sequences
4. New: `ElectionBroadcastChain.lean` — compose all three to show `RaftReachable` is
   closed under full election + replication

**Difficulty**: High. Requires connecting the abstract election model to the concrete
`RaftReachable` step, which bundles 5 hypotheses each of which needs to be discharged.

### Critique-Driven Adjustments (Run 82–85)

Based on Run 76 `CRITIQUE.md` recommendations and subsequent work:

1. **B1 (FUI modelling)** — DONE. `MaybePersistFUI.lean` (Run 84) closes MP6 gap.
   FU4 proves `maybePersistFui_eq_abstract` (concrete = abstract with derived FUI).

2. **B2 (ProgressSet)** — Still pending. The per-peer `Progress.lean` (31T) and
   `ProgressCorrespondence.lean` (55 #guard) provide a solid foundation.

3. **B3 (election-broadcast chain)** — Still pending. All component lemmas exist;
   the remaining task is composing them into a single end-to-end chain.

4. **Critique freshness** — `CRITIQUE.md` is from Run 76 (569T/50F). Current state is
   ~530T/55F (some theorem renamings may account for the count difference). An updated
   critique reviewing the Run 77–84 additions would be valuable.


## Run 103 Update (2026-04-25) — ConfigurationInvariants Correspondence + Research Refresh

### Current Project State (Run 103)

**65 Lean files, ~626 theorems, 0 sorry, 22 correspondence test targets, ~442 `#guard` tests.**

Key additions since Run 85:
- **Runs 96–102**: ProgressTracker.lean (PT1–PT21), election model extensions (RV1–RV8),
  ElectionCorrespondence.lean (23 `#guard`), MultiStepReachability.lean (MS1–MS7),
  ConfigurationInvariants.lean (CI1–CI8).
- **Run 103**: ConfigurationInvariantsCorrespondence.lean (15 `#guard`) — validates the
  `VotersLearnersDisjoint` invariant on 12 concrete configurations.

### Research Insight (Run 103): Correspondence Coverage Analysis

Run 103 completes correspondence tests for `ConfigurationInvariants`. One notable
finding from the correspondence test design:

**Case 5** (incoming=[1,2], outgoing=[1,2,3], learners=[], learners_next=[3]) shows that
the Lean `VotersLearnersDisjoint` invariant is **stricter** than a casual reading of the
Rust documentation might suggest. The Lean model includes
`outgoing_voters ∩ learners_next = ∅` as a required clause, but the Rust demotion scenario
explicitly creates a state where peer 3 appears in both `outgoing_voters` and `learners_next`.
This means the Lean invariant cannot be stated as a simple data invariant over the
intermediate joint-configuration state — it is a constraint on the _finalised_ configuration
only, or on the incoming-voters half of the joint config.

This gap (Lean model stricter than Rust semantics for the demotion case) should be noted
in `CRITIQUE.md` and may warrant a revised formulation of `VotersLearnersDisjoint` to
accurately capture the actual runtime invariant. It does not invalidate the existing CI
theorems (which prove structural properties given the invariant), but it means the invariant
as stated is not preserved through the joint-config transition for the demoted-voter case.

## Run 111 Update (2026-04-25)

### New Target: `has_next_entries_since` / `applied_index_upper_bound`

**File**: `src/raft_log.rs:465–491`

**Motivation**: The `applied_index_upper_bound` function governs a configurable optimistic-apply
window: entries may be applied up to `min(committed, persisted + max_apply_unpersisted_log_limit)`
without waiting for full persistence.  This is a subtle performance/safety trade-off not covered
by any prior FV target.

**Approach**: Pure functional model. Both functions are total; all inputs are `Nat`.

**Lean file**: `FVSquad/HasNextEntries.lean` — 14 theorems (HNE1–HNE14), 0 sorry.

**Key properties proved**:
- HNE1/HNE2: upper bound is bounded above by both `committed` and `persisted + limit`
- HNE3/HNE4: exact-value conditions (which side of min wins)
- HNE5–HNE7: monotonicity in all three parameters
- HNE8: zero-limit collapse to `min(committed, persisted)`
- HNE9: biconditional for `hasNextEntriesSince`
- HNE10: false-when-past-bound
- HNE11–HNE13: anti-monotone in `sinceIdx`, monotone in `committed`/`persisted`
- HNE14: `hasNextEntries = hasNextEntriesSince applied`

### Run 110 Finding: `UncommittedState` noLimit Divergence

Run 110 confirmed that when `max_uncommitted_size = 0`, the Lean model increments
`uncommittedSize` but the Rust returns early without updating state.  The boolean return
value is preserved; no proved theorem depends on the divergent state.  Documented in
`CRITIQUE.md §Run 110`.

### Current State (Run 111)

- **Lean files**: 68 (including new `HasNextEntries.lean`)
- **Theorems**: ~661 (647 prior + 14 new HNE theorems)
- **Sorry**: 0
- **Correspondence tests**: 23 targets, ~455 `#guard`
