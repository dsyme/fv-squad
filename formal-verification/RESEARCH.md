# Formal Verification Research — `raft-rs`

> 🔬 *Lean Squad — automated formal verification survey for this repository.*

## Repository Overview

`raft-rs` is a Rust implementation of the [Raft distributed consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/), forked from and used by [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv). It implements only the **core Consensus Module**; storage, state machine, and transport are left to consumers.

**Primary language**: Rust  
**Key crates**: `raft` (main), `raft-proto` (protobuf definitions), `harness` (test harness), `datadriven` (data-driven testing)

**Codebase size**: ~8,800 lines in `src/`, with extensive unit and data-driven tests.

## FV Tool Choice

**Tool**: Lean 4 with [Mathlib4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/)

**Rationale**:
- Lean 4 provides expressive dependent types suited to modelling Raft's data invariants.
- Mathlib offers rich automation (`omega`, `simp`, `decide`) and relevant libraries (lists, natural number arithmetic, finite sets).
- The project has no existing FV infrastructure in any other tool.
- The purely functional core of many Raft modules (quorum computation, log indexing) maps cleanly to Lean functions.

## Identified FV Targets

### Target 1 — `majority` utility + `MajorityConfig::vote_result` (★★★★★ Priority)

**Files**: `src/util.rs`, `src/quorum/majority.rs`

**What it does**: The `majority(n)` function computes `n/2 + 1`. `MajorityConfig::vote_result` uses it to determine whether a quorum of voters has approved a vote.

**Why FV**: This is the heart of Raft's safety guarantee. Getting quorum calculations wrong breaks the consensus invariant. The logic is simple enough to be fully proved in Lean.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. `majority(n) * 2 > n` — two majorities overlap
2. `majority(n) > 0` for `n > 0`
3. If `yes ≥ majority(n)`, result is `Won`
4. If `yes + missing < majority(n)`, result is `Lost`
5. If `yes < majority(n) ≤ yes + missing`, result is `Pending`
6. Empty voters config → always `Won` (by convention)

**Spec size**: ~40–60 Lean lines  
**Proof tractability**: `omega` and `decide` for arithmetic; `simp`+`cases` for the case analysis. Very tractable.  
**Approximations**: None — the logic is already pure and side-effect-free.

---

### Target 2 — `MajorityConfig::committed_index` (★★★★ Priority)

**File**: `src/quorum/majority.rs`

**What it does**: Given a map from voter IDs to their acknowledged log indices, computes the highest log index that a quorum of voters has acknowledged (i.e., the commit index).

**Why FV**: This is the core "what is committed" computation. An off-by-one error here would allow the leader to commit entries that haven't reached a quorum — a serious safety violation.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. The returned index is ≤ the index reported by at least `majority(n)` voters.
2. If all voters report the same index `i`, the committed index is `i`.
3. For an empty config, returns `u64::MAX` (by convention, plays well with joint quorum).
4. Monotonicity: if every voter's index increases, the committed index can only increase.

**Spec size**: ~80 Lean lines  
**Proof tractability**: Requires reasoning about sorted arrays and medians. Inductive + `omega`. Moderate difficulty.  
**Approximations**: The group-commit extension (multi-datacenter) adds complexity; initial spec can ignore `use_group_commit=true`.

---

### Target 3 — `Unstable` log buffer invariants (★★★ Priority)

**File**: `src/log_unstable.rs`

**What it does**: Maintains a buffer of log entries not yet persisted to stable storage, plus an optional snapshot. Entries are indexed: `entries[i].index == offset + i`.

**Why FV**: The index-offset invariant is critical. Violating it would mean `maybe_term` or `slice` return wrong entries, potentially leading the leader to commit wrong data.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. **Representation invariant**: if entries is non-empty, `entries[i].index == offset + i` for all `i`.
2. `maybe_last_index` returns `offset + entries.len() - 1` when entries is non-empty.
3. `maybe_term(idx)` returns `Some(t)` iff `idx` is in range.
4. `truncate_and_append` preserves the representation invariant.
5. After `stable_entries(index, term)`, `entries` is empty and `offset` advances correctly.

**Spec size**: ~120 Lean lines  
**Proof tractability**: Structural induction on list operations; moderate difficulty.  
**Approximations**: Must abstract away `Logger` (I/O); model entries as `(index: Nat, term: Nat)` pairs.

---

### Target 4 — `Inflights` ring buffer (★★★ Priority)

**File**: `src/tracker/inflights.rs`

**What it does**: A circular buffer tracking in-flight (sent but unacknowledged) log indices for each peer. Used for flow control.

**Why FV**: Ring buffer off-by-one errors are a classic source of bugs. The `add`/`free_to` operations must maintain the circular buffer invariant.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. **Capacity invariant**: `count ≤ cap` always holds.
2. **Content preservation**: after `add(x)`, `x` is in the logical window.
3. After `free_to(k)`, all entries `≤ k` are removed from the window.
4. `free_first_one` is equivalent to `free_to(buffer[start])`.
5. `reset` yields an empty, valid buffer.

**Spec size**: ~100 Lean lines  
**Proof tractability**: The wrapping arithmetic requires careful `omega`/`norm_num`. Moderate difficulty.  
**Approximations**: Model buffer as a list with phantom `start` index; abstract away `Vec` resizing.

---

### Target 5 — `limit_size` utility (★★ Priority)

**File**: `src/util.rs`

**What it does**: Truncates a list of entries so their total byte size does not exceed a given limit, but always keeps at least one entry.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. Result always has `len ≥ 1` (at least one entry preserved).
2. If `max = NO_LIMIT`, entries are unchanged.
3. Sum of sizes of retained entries ≤ `max` (when `len ≥ 2`).
4. First entry is always retained.

**Spec size**: ~50 Lean lines  
**Proof tractability**: Easy — `omega` + list reasoning. Good warmup.  
**Approximations**: Abstract away protobuf `compute_size`; model entry size as a natural number.

---

### Target 6 — `Progress` Replication State Machine (★★★★ Priority)

**Files**: `src/tracker/progress.rs`, `src/tracker/state.rs`

**What it does**: `Progress` is the Raft leader's per-follower view of the
replication pipeline. It is a three-state machine (Probe/Replicate/Snapshot)
with two key fields: `matched` (highest acknowledged log index) and `next_idx`
(next index to send). State transitions and the `maybe_update`/`maybe_decr_to`
operations update these fields with strict ordering constraints.

**Why FV**: The core invariant `matched + 1 ≤ next_idx` is critical for Raft
safety — violating it would cause the leader to send entries with incorrect
indices, breaking log consistency. The state transition logic (especially
`become_probe` from Snapshot state) has subtle max-of-two-bounds reasoning that
is easy to get wrong.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. **INV-1 (index ordering)**: `matched + 1 ≤ next_idx` — always holds.
2. `maybe_update(n)` sets `matched = max(old.matched, n)` and
   `next_idx = max(old.next_idx, n+1)`.
3. `maybe_update` returns `true` iff `n > old.matched`.
4. `become_probe` from Snapshot state sets `next_idx = max(matched+1, pending_snapshot+1)`.
5. All state transitions preserve INV-1.
6. `maybe_decr_to` in Replicate state never moves `next_idx` below `matched+1`.
7. `maybe_update` is monotone: if `n₁ ≤ n₂`, updating with `n₂` after `n₁`
   gives the same `matched` as updating directly with `n₂`.

**Spec size**: ~120 Lean lines (types + theorems)
**Proof tractability**: `omega` handles all arithmetic; `simp` + `cases` for
state discrimination. Very tractable — no induction required.
**Approximations**:
- `Inflights` (in-flight message tracker) omitted from model; `is_paused` in
  Replicate state approximated as always `false`.
- `committed_index` and `pending_request_snapshot` fields omitted.
- `u64` modelled as `Nat`.

---

### Target 7 — `JointConfig` Joint Quorum (★★★★ Priority)

**Files**: `src/quorum/joint.rs`

**What it does**: `JointConfig` holds two `MajorityConfig`s (incoming and outgoing). During
a Raft membership change (joint consensus), *both* majorities must agree on any decision.
`vote_result` returns Won only if both sub-quorums vote Won; Lost if either votes Lost;
Pending otherwise. `committed_index` returns `min(incoming_committed, outgoing_committed)`.

**Why FV**: Joint consensus is the mechanism Raft uses to safely change cluster membership —
getting it wrong leads to split-brain. The key safety property is that the joint committed
index is always ≤ either individual committed index (ensuring joint quorum is stricter than
a simple quorum). The vote aggregation logic (Won∧Won→Won, Lost∨Lost→Lost) is a clean
algebraic property amenable to exhaustive case analysis.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. **Vote-Won**: joint Won iff both incoming=Won and outgoing=Won.
2. **Vote-Lost**: joint Lost iff incoming=Lost OR outgoing=Lost.
3. **Vote-Pending**: joint Pending iff not Won and not Lost.
4. **Empty-config**: when outgoing is empty, joint result = incoming result.
5. **Commit-safety**: `jointCommittedIndex ≤ incoming` and `≤ outgoing`.
6. **Commit-monotone**: joint committed is monotone in both arguments.
7. **Commit-min**: joint committed = min(i_idx, o_idx).

**Spec size**: ~150 Lean lines (types + 20+ theorems)
**Proof tractability**: all proofs by `cases`/`simp` (3×3 = 9-case analysis for vote)
and `omega` for arithmetic (min properties). Zero induction required.
**Approximations**:
- `use_group_commit` flag and group-commit algorithm omitted (separate concern).
- `AckedIndexer` trait abstracted: majority committed index passed as a `Nat` argument.
- `u64` modelled as `Nat`.

### Target 8 — `is_up_to_date` + `find_conflict_by_term` Log Ordering (★★★★ Priority)

**Files**: `src/raft_log.rs` (lines 222–251, 437–441)

**What it does**: Two functions that govern Raft log comparison and conflict resolution:
- `is_up_to_date(last_index, term)` determines whether a candidate's log is at least as
  up-to-date as the voter's, implementing the Raft election restriction (§5.4.1).
- `find_conflict_by_term(index, term)` scans backward from `index` to find the largest log
  position with term ≤ the given term, enabling fast AppendEntries conflict resolution.

**Why FV**: The election restriction is a foundational Raft safety property — violations
cause split-brain. The preorder properties of `is_up_to_date` (reflexive, total, transitive,
antisymmetric) are exactly the Raft election safety conditions and can be fully proved in Lean.
`find_conflict_by_term` has a subtle potential `u64` underflow if the dummy-entry invariant
is violated, making it a good target for finding latent bugs.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. **Total preorder**: `isUpToDate` is reflexive, transitive, total, antisymmetric.
2. **Lex equivalence**: `isUpToDate(i,t) ↔ (t,i) ≥_lex (selfT, selfI)`.
3. **findConflict_le**: result ≤ input index (backward-bounded).
4. **findConflict_term_le**: the term at the result satisfies the term constraint.
5. **findConflict_maximality**: all entries strictly above the result have term > query.
6. **findConflict_mono**: monotone in index and term.

**Spec size**: ~250 Lean lines (no imports beyond Mathlib.Tactic)
**Proof tractability**: `omega` dominates for preorder; structural induction for scan.
**Approximations**:
- Log abstracted as `logTerm : Nat → Option Nat` (ignores storage/snapshot layout).
- `u64` modelled as `Nat` (no overflow).
- `index > last_index` guard omitted (modelled as precondition).

### Target 9 — `RaftLog::maybe_append` + `maybe_commit` Log Append (★★★ Priority)

**Files**: `src/raft_log.rs` (lines 262–336, 525–536)

**What it does**: The core AppendEntries RPC handler at the log level:
- `maybe_append(idx, term, committed, ents)` checks if the local log matches the leader
  at `(idx, term)`, finds any conflict in `ents`, appends the suffix, and advances the
  commit index. Returns `Some((conflict_idx, last_new_index))` on success, `None` on mismatch.
- `maybe_commit(max_index, term)` advances `committed` to `max_index` iff
  `log[max_index].term == term` and `max_index > committed`.

**Why FV**: These are the most safety-critical log operations. Key properties include:
- `commit_to` is monotone (committed never decreases).
- `maybe_commit` only advances when the term check passes (Leader Completeness).
- `maybe_append` never truncates already-committed entries.
- The `persisted` adjustment after conflict is correct (does not go past the conflict point).

**Key properties to verify**:
1. **Commit monotonicity**: `committed` only increases after `commit_to` / `maybe_commit`.
2. **Commit safety**: `maybe_commit` only advances if `log[max_index].term = term`.
3. **Append validity**: `maybe_append` returns `None` if terms don't match at `idx`.
4. **No-truncate-committed**: `find_conflict` never returns index ≤ committed (asserted, not proved).
5. **Persisted bound**: after conflict truncation, `persisted ≤ conflict_idx - 1`.
6. **Commit upper bound**: `commit_to(min(committed_from_leader, last_new_index))` ≤ last_new_index.

**Spec size**: ~200 Lean lines
**Proof tractability**: mostly `omega` + case analysis; requires modelling the log state.
**Approximations**:
- Log state modelled as a simple `Array Nat` (terms); no storage/snapshot layer.
- `find_conflict` modelled abstractly (its result is a free variable with spec constraints).
- `u64` modelled as `Nat`; panics (fatal!) modelled as precondition violations.
- `persisted` tracking included; `applied` tracking omitted as separate concern.

## Mathlib Modules of Interest

- `Mathlib.Data.List.Basic` — list lemmas for `truncate_and_append`
- `Mathlib.Data.Finset.Basic` — finite sets for voter configurations
- `Mathlib.Data.Finset.Card` — cardinality for quorum proofs
- `Mathlib.Order.Defs` — ordering for commit index monotonicity
- `Mathlib.Algebra.Order.Ring.Lemmas` — arithmetic for `majority`
- `Mathlib.Data.Nat.Defs` — natural number arithmetic

## General Approach

1. Model Raft concepts as simple Lean inductive types (ignoring protobuf, I/O, logging).
2. State correctness properties as `theorem` declarations.
3. Use `decide` for small finite cases; `omega` for arithmetic; induction for structural properties.
4. Explicitly document what the model does NOT capture (networking, storage I/O, failure modes).
5. Leave `sorry` as a placeholder for hard sub-goals; prefer partial proofs over no proofs.

### Target 15 — `RaftLog::next_entries_since` + `applied_index_upper_bound` (★★★ Priority)

**Files**: `src/raft_log.rs` (lines ~450–480)

**What it does**: `next_entries_since(since_idx, max_size)` returns the committed-and-ready-to-apply
slice of the log. The window is computed as:
- `offset = max(since_idx + 1, first_index())` — never goes below the compaction frontier
- `high   = applied_index_upper_bound() + 1`
- `applied_index_upper_bound() = min(committed, persisted + max_apply_unpersisted_log_limit)`

Returns `Some(entries[offset..high])` (subject to `max_size`) if `high > offset`, else `None`.

**Why FV**: This function controls exactly which entries reach the application state machine.
A wrong window (off-by-one, wrong clamping) could deliver entries twice or skip entries.
Key properties:
1. The upper bound is always ≤ committed (no uncommitted entries escape).
2. The upper bound is monotone in both `committed` and `persisted`.
3. The window is non-empty iff there exist new ready entries.
4. The lower clamp (`first_index`) ensures `offset` never underflows below the log start.
5. Non-decreasing: advancing `since_idx` never returns a lower-indexed set of entries.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. `appliedIndexUpperBound_le_committed` : `aub ≤ committed`
2. `appliedIndexUpperBound_le_persisted_add` : `aub ≤ persisted + limit`
3. `appliedIndexUpperBound_mono_committed` : monotone in committed
4. `appliedIndexUpperBound_mono_persisted` : monotone in persisted
5. `nextEntriesSince_none_iff` : returns None iff high ≤ offset
6. `offset_ge_first` : offset ≥ first_index always
7. `nextEntriesSince_since_mono` : larger `since_idx` ⇒ offset is no smaller

**Spec size**: ~200 Lean lines
**Proof tractability**: all `omega` + `Nat.min`/`max` lemmas from Mathlib; no induction needed
**Approximations**:
- Storage layer abstracted away; log modelled as arithmetic on indices only (no entry content).
- `max_size` / `limit_size` left as an axiom (already proved in `LimitSize.lean`).
- Panics modelled as preconditions.

### Target 16 — `RaftLog::append` (★★ Priority)

**Files**: `src/raft_log.rs` (lines ~377–395)

**What it does**: Validates that `ents[0].index - 1 >= committed` (no truncation of committed
entries), then delegates to `Unstable::truncate_and_append`. Returns the new `last_index`.

**Why FV**: Safety gate before the `truncate_and_append` already proved in `UnstableLog.lean`.
Key property: the guard prevents truncating below `committed`.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. Guard `after ≥ committed` is sufficient to prevent committed-entry truncation.
2. `last_index` after append equals `first_entry.index - 1 + len(ents)`.
3. If entries are empty, `last_index` is unchanged.

**Spec size**: ~100 Lean lines
**Proof tractability**: `omega`; reuse `UnstableLog.lean` model
**Approximations**: panics modelled as preconditions; `truncate_and_append` semantics imported from `UnstableLog.lean`.

---

### Target 17 — `RaftLog::entries` (★ Priority)

**Files**: `src/raft_log.rs` (lines ~401–415)

**What it does**: Returns entries `[idx, last_index+1)` subject to `max_size`, by delegating to `slice`. If `idx > last_index`, returns empty. The main logic is the bounds check and the slice call.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. If `idx > last_index`, result is empty.
2. Result length ≤ `last_index - idx + 1`.
3. Result respects `max_size` via `limit_size` (already proved).

**Spec size**: ~80 Lean lines
**Proof tractability**: trivial `omega`; mostly a spec-consistency check


---

### Target 19 — `Config::validate` (★★★ Priority)

**Files**: `src/config.rs`

**What it does**: Pure validation function that checks a `Config` struct satisfies 8 independent
constraints (C1–C8) required for a valid Raft node configuration. Returns `Ok(())` if all pass,
`Err(ConfigInvalid(...))` on the first failure. Used at node initialisation only.

The 8 constraints:
- C1: `id ≠ 0` (node identity validity)
- C2: `heartbeat_tick ≥ 1`
- C3: `election_tick > heartbeat_tick` (election timeout exceeds heartbeat)
- C4: `min_election_tick() ≥ election_tick`
- C5: `min_election_tick() < max_election_tick()` (timeout range non-empty)
- C6: `max_inflight_msgs ≥ 1`
- C7: `LeaseBased → check_quorum` (lease safety requirement)
- C8: `max_uncommitted_size ≥ max_size_per_msg`

Helper methods: `min_election_tick()` returns `election_tick` if field is 0, else the field;
`max_election_tick()` returns `2 * election_tick` if field is 0, else the field.

**Why FV**: This is a safety-critical initialisation guard. If any constraint is incorrectly
implemented or its logical implication is wrong, the node may start in an invalid state. The
exact-characterisation theorem (`validate_ok_iff`) provides a complete formal certificate of
the validation logic, including the C7 liveness/safety property for LeaseBased reads.

**Key properties to verify**:
1. `validate_ok_iff` — `validate() = Ok(()) ↔ C1 ∧ C2 ∧ C3 ∧ C4 ∧ C5 ∧ C6 ∧ C7 ∧ C8`
2. `validate_default_id_pos` — `{Config.default with id := n}.validate = Ok(()) ↔ n ≠ 0`
3. Derived: if valid, `election_tick ≥ 2`
4. Derived: if valid, `max_election_tick() > election_tick`
5. Decidability: all constraints are decidable propositions (C7 requires `ReadOnlyOption` to be an enum)
6. The tick range is always valid under defaults: when both `min_election_tick = 0` and `max_election_tick = 0`, C4/C5 reduce to `election_tick < 2 * election_tick`, provable by `omega` for `election_tick ≥ 1`.

**Spec size**: ~120 Lean lines
**Proof tractability**:
- All propositions decidable; most proofs by `decide` / `omega` / `simp`
- `validate_ok_iff` requires an 8-way `constructor` with `omega` for arithmetic constraints; straightforward but verbose
- No induction required
- No Mathlib imports beyond `Mathlib.Tactic`

**Approach**: Define `Config` as a Lean structure mirroring the Rust struct; define `ReadOnlyOption` as an inductive type; define `minElectionTick` and `maxElectionTick` as Lean functions; define `validateConfig` as a boolean predicate; state and prove `validate_ok_iff`.

**Approximations**:
- `ReadOnlyOption` modelled as a simple three-constructor inductive (Safe, ReadIndex, LeaseBased)
- All fields use unbounded `Nat` (instead of `u64`/`usize`)
- Error messages abstracted away (we care about Ok vs. Err, not the message content)
- `NO_LIMIT = u64::MAX` modelled as a special case or as a large constant; for proofs about default config, we treat `max_uncommitted_size = NO_LIMIT` as a hypothesis
